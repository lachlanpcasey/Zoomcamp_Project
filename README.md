# Cryptocurrency Data Engineering Project
This repository contains all the files and code necessary to run a data engineering project that pulls cryptocurrency data from an API, stores it in a data warehouse, processes it with DBT, and makes it available for analysis in a business intelligence tool.

The project is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy adaptation to different data sources and use cases. It includes scripts for pulling data from the API and storing it in a PostgreSQL database, as well as a set of DBT models for transforming the raw data into a clean, structured format. Additionally, the repository includes documentation and sample queries for accessing and analyzing the data in a business intelligence tool.

The project is built using open-source tools and frameworks, including Python, PostgreSQL, DBT, and Metabase. It is intended for educational purposes and can be used as a starting point for learning about data engineering and cryptocurrency data analysis.
